This repository contains the raw input and output data of the study “The Ecological Diversification of Flavobacteria: Linking Habitat Transitions to
Proterozoic Supercontinent Cycles”.

Relaxed_clock_gene: Includes the alignment sequences in the focal gene set.

mcmctree_raw_data: Contains the input files (sequence alignment, species tree with calibration and MCMCtree configuration file) for MCMCtree and the output time-tree of focal and test analyses.

Reltime_tree: Contains the time tree estimated using the branch length method implemented in MEGA, along with the time priors used for the estimation.

Dataset_S1: Taxa and accession numbers (or source databases) of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic species used in this study.

Dataset_S2: Taxa and accession numbers of the flavobacterial 16S amplicon sequences used in this study.
