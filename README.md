Relaxed_clock_trees: Contains time trees estimated using MCMCTree under various dating strategies.

Reltime_tree: Contains the time tree estimated using the branch length method implemented in MEGA, along with the time priors used for the estimation.

Dataset_S1: Taxa and accession numbers (or source databases) of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic species used in this study.

Dataset_S2: Taxa and accession numbers of the flavobacterial 16S amplicon sequences used in this study.
